# Chapter 2: Modern Science: From the Scientific Revolution to Present Day
Welcome back, dear readers. In our previous chapter, we explored the fascinating beginnings of science from ancient times to the Scientific Revolution. We learned about the notable figures who paved the way for scientific reasoning and the birth of the modern age.

In this chapter, we will continue our journey as we delve into the awe-inspiring growth and advancements of modern science. We will explore how the restlessness of the human mind and the insatiable thirst for knowledge led to revolutions in science that continue to shape our world today. And what better way to guide us through the scientific achievements of the modern era than with the wisdom of renowned astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

But first, we must ask ourselves, what makes the period of modern science so unique? Unlike prior centuries, at this time, scientific thought became less philosophical speculation and more experimental, empirical, and data-driven. The scientific revolution which we will discuss in detail, introduced new ways of thinking and a methodical approach to understanding the natural world. This era saw the birth of disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and physics that remain cornerstones of scientific endeavors in present times.

Join us in this chapter as we explore momentous discoveries of Modern Science that have repercussions from the smallest of scales, quantum mechanics, to the furthest reaches of the universe, astrophysics.

Let us embark on this journey, and together, let us discover how Modern Science has transformed our understanding of the world around us.
# The Myth of the Great Scientist

In ancient times, there was a great scientist named Atlas. He was known for his immense knowledge and ability to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Atlas spent his life studying the stars, the planets, and the laws that govern them. He was revered by all who knew him, and his ideas unlocked new pathways to scientific advancement.

However, as Atlas aged, he became obsessed with a question that haunted him night and day. How could he uncover the secrets of the universe that had yet to be discovered? Atlas spent many sleepless nights contemplating this question, until his restless mind led him on a journey of discovery that would revolutionize science as we know it.

One fateful night, Atlas had a dream that would change his life. In the dream, he was visited by the great scientist, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Neil took Atlas on a journey through time, showing him the birth of the scientific revolution, the discoveries of the modern era, and the implications of scientific advancement for the future.

Through the vision that Neil imparted on Atlas, he realized that to unlock the secrets of the universe, he had to look beyond the traditional boundaries of science. He had to be willing to venture into unknown territory. Atlas knew that the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe lay in the data-driven, empirical method of science.

Using this method, Atlas made many breakthroughs. He discovered the laws of thermodynamics, the properties of the atom, and the behavior of subatomic particles. His work laid the foundation for the discoveries that would shape the modern era.

As Atlas continued to unravel the secrets of the universe, his work inspired a new generation of scientists. The torch of scientific curiosity was passed from one generation to the next, and the world was forever changed.

And so, we see that the journey of science is a never-ending one. As long as there are scientists who are willing to venture into the unknown, the secrets of the universe will continue to unfold. The legacy of Atlas and the many scientists who came before him will continue to inspire future generations to push the boundaries of science and unlock the secrets of the cosmos.
To resolve the Greek Mythology epic, we used the following code:

```python
def resolve_epic(epic):
    # Define the main characters of the story
    atlas = "Atlas"
    tyson = "Neil deGrasse Tyson"
    
    # Check if both characters are present in the epic
    if atlas in epic and tyson in epic:
        # If both characters are present, then the story has been resolved
        print("The story has been resolved! Atlas was able to unlock the secrets of the universe with the help of Neil deGrasse Tyson.")
    else:
        # If either character is missing, something is amiss in the story
        print("Something's not right. The story is incomplete. Please check for the presence of Atlas and Neil deGrasse Tyson.")
```

The code checks if both Atlas and Neil deGrasse Tyson are present in the epic. If they are both present, the code states that the story has been resolved. However, if either character is missing, the code suggests that the story is incomplete and prompts the user to check for their presence in the epic.

In our case, since we included both characters in the introduction and myth of the chapter on Modern Science, the code would output, "The story has been resolved! Atlas was able to unlock the secrets of the universe with the help of Neil deGrasse Tyson."
